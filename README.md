# Parallel-Distributed-Systems-Homework2
This is the Parallel & Distibuted Computer Systems Homework 2: Distributed k-select.

The following Julia script executed a distributed threaded k select of a random array with variable size and given k statistical value.

The script should run on the Aristotelis campus HPC with the appropriate configuration of MPI and Julia scripts: More info can be seen [here](https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/stable/configuration/)

For the correct setup of the HPC follow the instructions found [here](https://hpc.it.auth.gr/)
